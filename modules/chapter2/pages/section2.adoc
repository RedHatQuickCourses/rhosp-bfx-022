1. Connect to the workstation VM's console to access the instance's console.
+
Refer to the Access instanceâ€™s console instructions under Additional information section of Break-fix Activity page.

2. From GUI console of workstation, connect to director VM and get the instance's console URL.
+
----
(overcloud) [stack@director ~]$ openstack console url show scenario-bfx022-vm
+-------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field | Value                                                                                         |

The preceding output can differ in your environment.
+
Upon accessing the console, you might get the "Kernel panic" boot failure message, indicating the VM was not successfully booted.

3. There could be something wrong with vm's configuration. Use openstack server show to check details of the instance.
+
----
(overcloud) [stack@director ~]$ openstack server show scenario-5-vm
. . .
flavor                              | m1.tiny (3ab59dd5-f848-4bb7-becb-c4b4ac459507)
. . .
----
+
Observe that flavor being used for the instance is not enough (m1.tiny with 64mb RAM).


4. List available flavors on the cluster.
+
----
(overcloud) [stack@director ~]$ openstack flavor list
+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
| ID                                   | Name      | RAM | Disk | Ephemeral | VCPUs | Is Public |
+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
| 3ab59dd5-f848-4bb7-becb-c4b4ac459507 | m1.tiny   |  64 |    1 |         0 |     1 | True      |
| c3bf3d17-23f3-481d-813e-9ada4d47b368 | m1.medium | 512 |   10 |         0 |     1 | True      |
+--------------------------------------+-----------+-----+------+-----------+-------+-----------+
----
+
We have m1.medium flavor with better ram.

5. Change the flavor of the instance to use m1.medium.
+
----
(overcloud) [stack@director ~]$ openstack server resize --flavor m1.medium scenario-bfx022-vm
----
+
Observe the console url again and note the VM is now booted and is on login prompt.

6. Connect to the instance using ssh:
+
----
(overcloud) [stack@director ~]$ ssh -i /home/stack/osp_training/.scenariobfx022/scenario-bfx022-key.pem cirros@172.25.250.186

== Evaluation

As the stack user on the director machine, use the lab command to grade your work. Correct any reported failures and rerun the command until successful.
----
[stack@director ~]$ lab grade bfx022
----

== Finish

Run the lab finish command to complete this exercise. This step is important to ensure that resources from previous exercises do not impact upcoming exercises.
----
[stack@director ~]$ lab finish bfx022
----
This concludes the section.
